# Agile is Dead. Long Live Agility
## by Dave Thomas, GoTo Conference Recording, 2015

- Agile is not a methodology. It's more of a philosophy. It's more of a way to do things, as opposed to a marketing noun that is a practice.

## Steps to be agile
1. Find out where you are
2. Take a small step towards your goal. 
  - When faced with two or more alternatives that deliver roughly the same value, take the path that make future change easier.
3. Adjust your understanding based on what you learned.
4. Repeat
